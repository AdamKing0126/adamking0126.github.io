I'm Adam King, a software developer based in Central Texas.  I've been writing software professionally since 2016.  Most of my experience is in Python/Django but I've been working in Ruby/Rails for the last couple years.  I'm teaching myself Go and hope to use it in a professional capacity soon.

I like the idea of owning my own corner of the web, and having a spot to save things that I find interesting.  Writing is hard for me, I'm never really sure what to write about, everything seems like it's already been written.  That said, I have thoughts and I want to get them out.  So here we are.
