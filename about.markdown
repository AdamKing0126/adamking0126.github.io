I'm Adam King, a software developer based in Central Texas.  I've been writing software professionally since 2016.  Most of my experience is in Python/Django but I've been working in Ruby/Rails for the last couple years.  I'm teaching myself Go and hope to use it in a professional capacity soon.

I got laid off for the first time in 2023 and it was a tough time.  One of my key learnings from that experience was that, yes, the hiring experience for software developers still sucks, and it's even worse when you're not looking for a job while still employed.  I am happily employed again, working as a contractor to the VA, but that experience has left me with some PTSD I'm trying to work through.  Aside from having a financial safety net, it occurred to me that a key component to ensuring constant employment is participating in social/professional networks.  This site is the first step in that venture.
