# I Got Laid Off a Year Ago and I Still Don't Know How to Feel About It

In the height of the pandemic, my employer merged with another company and the shift in company culture felt uncomfortable.  Rather than working through that, I took the advantage of the lucrative market and job hopped.  In addition to a healthy salary bump, I joined a company with name recognition, which felt like doing my future self a favor - the *next next* job would be easier to get, and could maybe unlock an even bigger opportunity.  I made lots of plans for myself and my family.  I'd made it!

Initially, things were great.  Every person I encountered was kind and helpful.  The onboarding went smoothly, and DevEx was absolutely fantastic - as a company founded by an engineer, priority was placed on developer happiness and productivity.  I really felt like I'd hit the jackpot.  But the shine started diminsishing.  Bit by bit, problems started coming up.  Looking back, it wasn't like any specific issue was a "red flag".  It was more like a set of scales - there was a lot of weight on the positive side, but little by little more weight was added to the negative.

I was hired at the beginning of August and three months into my tenure, my manager left on an extended maternity leave.  This coincided with the end of my official onboarding, so I was left a little in the lurch.  No problem, I was assured. "Things slow down around the holidays here"  This was not an exaggeration.  No new feature work was allotted, and lots of people took the entire month of December off.  I was not assigned to any significant projects over the holidays, so I took the time to refamiliarize myself with Ruby and Rails (I had written Python for the past 5 or 6 years).

When January rolled around, my engineering department went through a reorganization.  This was fine by me; I still didn't have a manager and hadn't had an opportunity to work on any significant projects.  We had an onsite event where we made some good steps towards defining our new mission and teams.  I left feeling excited and energized.  It had been a slow start but my coworkers had urged patience and it looked the anxiety I'd felt over the last months was misplaced.  In our new teams, we got started on new projects.  We built off ideas we'd discussed at the onsite, and pair programmed every day.  These days are the best memories of this job, and I'm striving to bring this experience forward.  I really liked the low-stakes "scrappy prototyping" that we did: just make it work, don't worry if it's ugly or inefficient.  Find the dark corners and weird edge cases.  Write tests that you'll save for the final product.  Pair programming also gave me an opportunity to demonstrate my skills, if only to my coworkers.

At this point, I received my first performance review from my new manager and was rated as "off track".  This wasn't exactly like getting put on a PIP (performance improvement plan), which, as far as I can tell, is more like the first step in laying a paper trail in order to have cause to terminate someone.  Not a PIP, but maybe the step before a PIP.  I was confused.  I'd done my onboarding and then spent the winter holidays without a manager.  I'd only been given the sort of work which is given to a developer who's new to the team: bug fixes, minor improvements, etc.  I'd only had a couple one-on-ones with my new manager, but I'd felt like we'd established a good rapport.  I'd received no feedback about my work, except for assurances not to worry, things would pick up and we'd get good projects to work on.  In retrospect, I really wish I had pushed back against my manager after my review. Feedback from him was that I'd spent too much time and energy focused on bringing my Rails skills up.  I didn't go away from the conversation with a good idea of what I could've done differently.  My manager *did* assure me that the work I'd completed over the previous weeks was good, and that I was proving myself to be a valuable member of the team.  But the time period addressed in this performance review was before the new work had begun.  I felt like I'd been given a raw deal, that my first 4 or 5 months at the job had been a bit of a wasted opportunity, but good things were in store in the future.  I chose to adopt a forward-looking attitude.

I was determined to put on a good face.  I was ready to admit that for my part, I could have worked harder to find projects I could contribute to, could have learned to work around the system.  True, I didn't have a manager and didn't really understand how the company worked or the way the application functioned. But surely I could've done *something* different.  Regardless, I was ready to fully commit to the new team, and now that our department had realigned, I was going to demonstrate the value I could bring to the company.  In a devastating blow, the project I was working on was de-prioritized and shelved.  The official explanation was that because the changes we were working on was a part of the application that hadn't achieved a high level of user adoption, it couldn't be advertised as a major improvement to the users.  The company had taken a page from Apple (and the other FAANG firms), where improvements to the platform should feel like Steve Jobs announcing, "one more thing."  The way new features and functionality were planned and roadmapped required quite a bit of political wrangling and negotiation.  A high priority was placed on the impact that new functionality would have on the end user, and at each step of the process, a proposed change was weighed against others.  This honestly makes a lot of sense, but for one small issue: there simply wasn't enough "high impact" work available to me.  The company had grown rapidly over the previous 18 months, and was in the process of validating the thesis of the "Mythical Man Month".  More engineers does not make more productivity.

I don't have the proper perspective, so I can only parrot the stories I've heard.  During the pandemic, a lot of the bigger companies, especially those who were well situated to shift to 100% remote work, kicked their hiring up a notch.  Interests rates were at rock bottom levels, and I'm sure some folks thought the pandemic reality was going to be the new reality - we were a digital world now, a digital economy.  We'd quit going to movie theaters and we were streaming movies to our new home theaters.  We were getting our groceries delivered or picking up curbside - we were done with shopping in grocery stores.  It created a bit of a gold rush for employers:  get the good talent before it's scooped up by Google or Facebook or whoever.  Plus it made the companies look forward-thinking and proactive. So for whatever the reason, I was a part of the gold rush.  I was eager to prove myself, eager to earn my wage.  Eager to show my new employer that they'd made a good choice in hiring me.  Unfortunately, I didn't get the chance.  I was laid off, along with 20% of the company.

## Being laid off sucks and is sometimes awesome

During my job search, I'd open LinkedIn and see countless posts like, "I've been impacted by the layoffs at XYZ.  I had the most amazing time there and I'm looking for my next adventure!"  Theater.  Thousands of people thanking the employer who'd just laid them off.  Presenting the experience as bittersweet.  The performative aspect of it is and was very difficult for me.  I did not make such an announcement, did not apply the "Open for work" banner to my profile picture.

Being laid off and going through the process of applying for jobs, knowing that I was competing with thousands of other people were in the same position, that was pretty rough.  Feeling like I had spent the previous year spinning my wheels was like salt in the wound.  Was I even cut out to be a developer, in the first place?  That name recognition that my new company gave me?  Turns out that was a two-edged sword: everybody wanted to know what it was like, what kind of neat stuff I'd been involved in.  I felt like I hadn't done *anything* of note.  I inflated the impact of the work that I'd done, and quickly shifted the conversation to my previous employer, where I'd done work that I was *actually* proud of.

So, what did I do?  I didn't do any leetcoding.  Didn't build a side project.  Didn't attend any meetups (have meetups recovered from the pandemic lockdown yet?  Online meetups are terrible and useless).  I applied for jobs and focused on my mental health.  I live in a great walkable town, and I bought used bicycles for my family and learned how to work on them.  We rode to the river and went swimming most days.  I regret that I didn't take a trip, didn't really go anywhere.  The job search was front of mind, and while not necessarily a full-time job, I had interviews of one stage or another almost every day of the week.  It was a strange feeling, of being in a rush but at the same time not having anything to do.

Mercifully, my previous employer awarded me a very generous severance.  That, combined with unemployment benefits and savings, allowed me to stay afloat.  All told, I spent about six months looking for work.  In the end, I actually had multiple offers.  I've been at my new job for about six months, and in retrospect I feel like it's all worked out for the best.  I still feel ill at ease, however.  I've got feelings, and I don't know what to do with them.


## I have no idea what advice I'd give someone

"Take care of your mental health."  That's about it.  I think once you've gotten laid off, there's not a lot you can do.  The work you need to do to make yourself layoff-resistant takes time.
