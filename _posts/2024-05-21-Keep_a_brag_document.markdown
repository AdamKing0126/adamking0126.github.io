# Why Aren't You Keeping a Brag Document?

I remember, in a previous life, I worked with a marketing company as they undertook a rebranding on behalf of my employer.  I was having a conversation with their designer about some ideas he had and he pulled a small notebook out of his pocket.  Have you seen Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade? This was like Henry's notebook.  Beautiful, meticulous notes, all in ink with flawless penmanship.  There were at least four different colors of ink, and not a single crossed-out word.  I can imagine that at his desk there are dozens of similar notebooks, each dedicated to a different client and project.  Part of a life's work.

God, how cool would it be if I had a thing like that.  I could build a bookcase above my desk, and open one up when I needed inspiration. It's a beautiful dream.  Try as I might, I am just not that organized.  I don't keep a "second brain" in Logseq or Obsidian.  I don't "bullet journal"  I have a handful of beautiful journals that I'm afraid to spoil with my chicken scratch and meandering thoughts.  My notetaking system is a spiral notebook (for keeping track of todos) and text files (for saving code snippets). My problem is my short term memory.  I can't trust it, so if something's important, I need to write it down.  Because I'm so afraid of forgetting, I can actually get stuck in a thought loop, "Remember to address that request your coworker gave you.  Don't forget! Remember! Remember!"  If I don't jot it down, my mind won't let me move forward. It's not pretty, but it works. I'm (relatively) functional with this strategy.

My spiral notebook gets me through the day, but it's a far cry from a highly curated "second brain".  The entries in there tend to lose their relevance after a week or so.  So where's the middle ground? If I can't be bothered with Logseq and my handwriting's too poor for those leather-bound Italian notebooks, how do I keep track of things that *are* worth remembering.  Enter the brag document.

## Bragging Ain't All Bad

It's not a hard concept to wrap your head around, really. A brag document is just a list of the things you've worked on that you're proud of, or at least think are worth remembering.  For me especially, it's great for recording things that I will remember the broad strokes on, but I can't recall the precise details.  For example, I reworked an API endpoint which was throwing lots of errors - thousands per day - each of which resulted in a negative user experience.  I definitely remember that, but I can't tell you any more specifics.  

In my brag document, I've got screenshots from Datadog dashboards, links to the PRs that were related to the work, people I interacted with, etc.  I can tell you I reduced the error rating for that endpoint by 99% - from 32k in May, 2023 to just a couple hundred in May of 2024.  I can tell you how many lines of code I wrote, how much I removed, etc.  None of that information would've survived in my spiral notebook.

I don't limit the contents of my brag document to strictly code changes.  I don't really have aspirations towards management, but part of a software developer's responsibilities as they become more senior is to demonstrate leadership and mentoring.  My current team was formed around the same time I was hired, so I include things that demonstrate that I've helped to establish a culture of pair programming and collaboration.  I've documented interactions with the client, talked about times I pushed back on their expectations, presented alternatives that were better for the team, described how I can communicate to non-technical people about complicated subjects.

## What's it All For?

So, my brag document isn't a second brain, it isn't a compendium of all the knowledge and skills that I've accumulated over time.  It's not really even very helpful, on a day-to-day basis.  But it definitely comes in handy.

First of all, it's great resume fodder.  Depending on the job I'm applying for, I can cherry-pick the best entries from my brag document to tailor my application to the company or client.  Secondly, it's helpful to refer to when speaking with my manager or skip-level.  I've found that, prior to 1:1s, reviewing recent entries in my brag document makes me feel more prepared, and able to use that time more effectively.

Finally, it's a great way to boost my self confidence when imposter syndrome strikes.  It can sometimes be really difficult to move from the known to the unknown, whether it's starting a new project, working with a new team, or a new job entirely.  The brag document reminds me that I've been in this place before, I've overcome that feeling of discomfort.  It reminds me that while my job title might be "software developer," what I really get paid to do is to learn new things, to solve problems.

## Give it a Shot

A brag document doesn't require daily (or even weekly) grooming and tending.  It doesn't require you learn a bunch of new tools and techniques.  It's not a major commitment of time.  I update my brag document every two weeks along with our sprint cycle.  I'm already in the mindset of recapping what I've worked on, so it's not a big deal.  Why not give it a try?  It might feel a little weird or clumsy at first, but give it a few months.  I you'll be surprised.
